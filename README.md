# PG&E Status

## About

This is a program to query PG&E service status in a sane and reasonable way. The
primary product here is a web application with a simple text based search. When
you execute a search for an address of interest, it brings you to a page that:

- Is small in size so it's easy to load when your connection is compromised say
  because .... your power is out and you're on a flaky LTE connection.

- Refreshes the information you are looking at in response to a browser page
  refresh. 

This is in stark contrast to the morass of unrelenting agony that is the
PG&E outage center which is: massively bloated and takes forever to load, takes a
horrendous number of navigation actions to get any useful information during an
outage, and then makes you do the whole thing over every time you want an update.

With this app you can get the information you need with one search, and simply
refresh your browser from there for updates.
